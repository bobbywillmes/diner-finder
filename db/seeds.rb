Two local businessmen wanted to open a restaurant that would serve quality food, great cocktails and a fun gaming environment. They looked at the Old Bills Casino on Highway 50 in Stateline NV, and wanted to bring some life back to the classic building. Our restaurant was opened on July 4, 2012 and has been a very popular spot for both locals and tourists. Since the day we opened our guests have been championing our Burgers as the best in the state of Nevada and some say the best in the country. That is a bold claim but check out our recommendations on Facebook or our reviews on Yelp to confirm it. Pat LaFrieda, famous from his family\'s meat purveyor business and the Food Network created our patty. It is a combination of chuck roast and short rib that is meshed together and then chopped into a 1/2 pound patty. The patty is cooked to perfection on our custom grill and this is what makes it so outstanding. Our logo was not created specifically for us, it is a famous painting in the Southern California community. The painting was done in 1981 and the model, whose name is Clementine, was the artists\' girlfriend at the time. She is laying on a classic Chris Craft boat in Newport Harbor. The artist, Gary Miltimore of Newport Ca, gave us permission to use it as he is a personal friend of our owners. We have now opened our second location in Reno and look forward to many additional locations.',history:'Established in 2014. Our story is a short one but a good one. Two local businessmen wanted to open a restaurant that would serve quality food, great cocktails and a fun gaming environment. They looked at the Old Bills Casino on Highway 50 in Stateline NV, and wanted to bring some life back to the classic building. Our first restaurant was opened on July 4, 2012 and has been a very popular spot for both locals and tourists. Since the day we opened our guests have been championing our Burgers and Steaks as the best in the state of Nevada and some say the best in the country. That is a bold claim but check out our recommendations on Facebook or our reviews on Yelp to confirm it. Pat LaFrieda, famous from his family\'s meat purveyor business and the Food Network created our patty. It is a combination of chuck roast and short rib that is meshed together and then chopped into a 1/2 pound patty. The patty is cooked to perfection on our custom rotating grill and this is what makes it so outstanding.',user: User.find(2)},

SUSHISAMBA is born of the energy and spirit of these three distinct cultures; a tri-cultural coalition that took root in the early 20th century. Thousands of Japanese emigrants traveled to South America\'s fertile soil to cultivate coffee plantations and find their fortune. In bustling cities like Lima in Peru, and Sao Paulo in Brazil, the integration of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cultures flourished. This cultural phenomenon launched a culinary coup. Hearty moquecas and colorful seviches found a place at the table along side simple miso soup and tender sashimi. SUSHISAMBA serves these traditional dishes, plus more inventive fare, including sashimi seviche, tuna tataki, and our south american beef maki roll.

  Established in 2006. 

  In 1967, the young Jim + Virginia Johnston family built a home on their farm to raise sons Joe, Steve + Paul. The expanses of grass and abundant, mature trees made for a great childhood. As the sons grew and were married, the home was used by the new families. As the family farm gave way to the new Agritopia development (neighborhoods + urban farming), the home was redeveloped into what is now Joe\'s Farm Grill. The architectural vision was to create a retro-futuristic burger stand. Notable touches are the butterfly roof, Jetsonian restrooms, LCD displays, automated condiment station, and a glass box kitchen. The food concept was to take the burger stand menu to the next level and to use as much of the produce grown on the adjacent The Farm at Agritopia (@agritopiafarm) as possible. Since opening, the restaurant has continued to grow, fueled by "Free Cheeseburger Day" every November and being featured on Food Network\'s "Drive-ins, Diners and Dives" with Guy Fieri.',history:'Established in 2006.

We use only pecan wood -- no gas or electric ovens. All of our meats are dry rubbed and cooked VERY SLOWLY using smoke and mild heat. This results in tender, flavorful meat.

We peel whole cases of apples for our applesauce, make rich cheese sauce for our mac n\' cheese ... whatever it takes to make the sides special. Our biggest sellers include bbq pit beans, cheesy potatoes, and over-the-top mac n\' cheese. Giant baked potatoes (+1 pound) are a big hit. Available with all of the fixings or topped with one of our smoked meats, they are certainly a meal in themselves. Non-alcoholic beverages include a wide range of bottled sodas, but the stand-out is our homemade root beer. It is also available as a root beer float. A nice selection of beer, wine and cocktails is also available. Desserts are homemade: sweet/tart lemon cake, root beer cake, chocolate chip cookies and peach cobbler.',history:'Established in 1998. On January 20, 1998, Joe\'s Real BBQ opened for business. On our first day, we served over 1,000 customers and business stayed very strong. We were all scrambling and tired, but were able to slowly get organized and stabilize the business. Since that time, we have tried to be true to the motto of Joe\'s Real BBQ, which is "Clean, Delicious, Friendly and Quick." There have been a few changes over time - the original "retail market" became an ice cream stand and, later, additional seating, while an additional covered patio was added to the north. A third Oyler pit was added to meet increased volume. We added locally sourced braised greens and other vegetarian options in 2019. Beer, wine and cocktails made their debut as well. Joe\'s continues to be a family owned and operated restaurant. We all live in Gilbert and are proud to be able to be a part of this growing community.',user: User.find(1)},

The partner\'s spent more than a year searching the entire Valley for the perfect location, and in August of \'08, stumbled upon the old, hexagonal windowed, peak roofed building at 4700 N. Central Ave. Not only did the original A-frame design of the building lend itself to the Polynesian theme, but the community exuded the kind of character, diversity and soul that they were all looking for. This incarnation of HULA\'S is completely unique, and reflects the urban renewal of the Central corridor.

The pasties were made with a thick crimped edge along one side; which the miners would use as a handle and hold onto while eating. This was extremely useful because a miner\'s hand would often be covered in arsenic from the mines. The miners would discard the handle when they were done, so they could never poison themselves while eating. The crusts were never wasted, though, as many miners were believers that ghosts, or "knockers", inhabited the mines. The leftovers of the crusts would keep these ghosts content. The wives and mothers of the miners would make the pasties with different fillings at each end - one with a sweet filling, which would be marked with an initial so the miner would not eat his dessert first, and the other with meat and vegetables.',user: User.find(1)},

Therefore, Lockhart Smokehouse is the only place in the DFW area you can get Kreuz Market Sausage. And in the old world tradition, the meat is served on butcher paper straight from the smoker by the friendly folks at the counter.

"Shorty Scout" Zietz, easily recognized as one of the most colorful figures of the Old West. The Buckhorn Exchange derives its name from the Rio Grande Railroad yards that were directly across Osage Street and the second-story Buckhorn Lodge that housed railroaders for the night. Each Friday, the railroaders scrambled across Osage Street to exchange their paychecks for gold. In return, Zietz handed each man a token good for a free lunch and a beer. A great deal has changed at the Buckhorn since 1893, yet much is as it was in the days when the clientele packed six-guns, silver barons rubbed elbows with roustabouts, miners shook dirt out of their clothing along with gold dust, and "Shorty Scout" entertained the customers with tales of the decade he spent on the frontier.',user: User.find(9)},

After a combined 23 years in the fine dining scene all across the country, we decided it was time to slow life down a little bit and do our own thing, and what better thing than pizza and beer? While living in San Diego, the idea of Hops & Pie was born. Partially inspired by living in close proximity to Stone, Lost Abbey, Port, Green Flash and Ballast Point Breweries, we began to develop a love for hand crafted beer. We soon learned that good IPA and pepperoni pizza were made for each other. That inspired us to start creating different pies to see how they paired with different beers, and we soon learned that the sky was the limit. So we packed up, moved to the Napa Valley of beer, and started looking for a home for Hops & Pie. We were lucky to find a space on Tennyson in the Berkeley neighborhood of Denver. It took a little over six months to design, build, and open up. And here we are, bringing North Denver our idea of the perfect combination: craft beer and artisan pizza.',user: User.find(9)},
